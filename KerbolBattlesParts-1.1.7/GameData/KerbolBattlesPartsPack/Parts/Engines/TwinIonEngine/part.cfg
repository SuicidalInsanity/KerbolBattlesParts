	description = A precision engineered high efficiency ion propusion unit. Featuring twin maneuvering nozzles for enhanced maneuvarability and no moving parts for enhanced durability, this engine is an excellent go to propulsion unit for any light space craft. As an added bouns, the electrical feedback howl produced when the engine and radio are on at the same time is guaranteed to keep the crew awake and alert during long burns.
