OVERVIEW
===================================================================================================================
Adds kerbalized parts from a popular sci-fi series to KSP

INSTALLATION
===================================================================================================================
Place the GameData/KerbolBattlesPack and Gamedata/JSI folders into your KSP/Gamedata directory 
(Optional) Place the ships folder in your Kerbal Space program folder, and overwrite files if asked to do so. This will add example craft to KSP.
(optional)Remove KerbolBattlesPack/patches/IonEngineAtmoBuff.cfg - Without the patch, the engine included in this pack acts like a normal, abet OP Ion engine. With the patch, the engine now runs on SpaceMagic and is ludicrously OP in a normal game.
